# 0. Prelude
In my decade or so as a software developer, I've encountered multiple technologies that all roughly fit a similar mold&mdash;omnipresent but unloved, widely present but equally widely resented.
A common giveaway is how your (future) coworkers discuss them: a shrug; a half-chuckle; perhaps a vague reference to a long-buried ticket or branch that prompts a silent, dead-eyed stare.
We've all done it:

"Yeah...we use JIRA. Sorry..."

"We've been meaning to replace Celery, but..."

"We should discuss what to do about Redis for our next Tech Debt sprint (whenever that happens.)"
