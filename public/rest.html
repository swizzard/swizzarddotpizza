      <p>
        if you're reading these words on a web browser you're doing
        <code>REST</code> right now. <code>URI</code>s, status codes,
        <i>the concept of headers</i> are all 'REST'
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>REST</code> is not a religion or your parents. it's a set of
        <strong>good ways to do things</strong>. many of those ways are good
        enough that other people might get mad at you if you do things
        differently, but no-one is making you behave
      </p>
      <p>
        e.g. GraphQL isn't 'not REST', it just doesn't conform as much as
        other architectures might
      </p>
      <p>
        Fielding goes to great lengths to emphasize that
        <code>REST</code> and other pieces of the web like <code>HTTP</code>
        were all created by different people working in different places,
        discretely.
      </p>
      <p>
        there is no "web library" made by one entity that everyone has to
        use, there is no one language, it's just a set of standards
      </p>
      <p class="important">
        the possibility of non-, mis-, or malcompliance has always existed.
        entities have been accidentally or willfully misunderstanding and
        misimplementing <code>REST</code> since before it existed. just do
        your best

        <details>
          <summary>aside: evaluation</summary>
          generally speaking i found Fielding's methodology for evaluating
          architectures to be admirable but academic (derogatory). i just
          can't imagine doing all that in e.g. a meeting with product would
          actually help. maybe i'm just cynical.
        </details>

          a component is differentiated and discrete, defined by its
          boundaries, its edges, its surface, its interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          the interface is public, the insides are private and can be changed
          how- and whenever
        </p>
        <p>components contain other components</p>
        <details>
          <summary>e.g.</summary>
          <p>
            your application is a component, containing your web application,
            email service, mobile app, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            your web application is a component, containing your http server,
            monitoring integrations, task queues, caches, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            your http server is a component, containing your 'create an
            article' handler, login/logout handlers, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            your 'create an article' handler is a component, containing
            functions that interact with the database, validate inputs, format
            outputs, etc.
          </p>
          <p>and so forth</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>aside: want/have/need</summary>
          <p>
            i like to think about <strong>want</strong>,
            <strong>have</strong>, and <strong>need</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            one component, let's call it the <i>caller</i> (although it
            needn't be a function),
            <strong>wants</strong>
            something from another component
          </p>
          <p>
            maybe it wants a user session, maybe it wants a list of posts,
            maybe it wants access to some shared memory
          </p>
          <p>
            the other component (<i>callee</i>, i guess)
            <strong>needs</strong> certain things from the caller
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            maybe it needs a photo of a check, maybe it needs the value of a
            certain header, maybe it needs either nothing or an object or a
            string or between one and seven numbers
          </p>
          <p>
            the key is to make sure the caller <strong>has</strong> what the
            callee <strong>needs</strong>, and the callee returns what the
            caller <strong>wants</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            it seems obvious but you'd be surprised how easy it is to forget

            basically boils down to "your users
            aren't (necessarily)

            it seems obvious but you'd be surprised how easy it is to forget
          </p>
          <p>sometimes one gets a vision of Fielding's (imagined, intended) audience</p>
          <p>when one has never not done '<code>REST</code>ful' web development,
            one can forget that the things one needs to consider when doing '<code>REST</code>ful' web development
            differ from the things one might need to consider when getting the robot arms to work together,
            or making sure people on floor 7 don't use the printer on floor 6</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>the <code>S</code> in <code>REST</code> stands for <code>State</code></h4>
          <p>Fielding is <i>very</i> insistant on the client handling state</p>
          <p>this might surprise you (it surprised me) but</p>
          <p>the <code>state</code> Fielding means is <strong>the state of the interaction</strong></p>
          <p>basically: the client drives</p>
          <p>e.g.: the user's browser sends a <code>GET</code> request with the right headers to <code>/profile</code>,
            and the server returns text that the user's brower renders as a web page, one that includes a form.
            the user's brower then sends a <code>PATCH</code> request to <code>/profile</code> with
            the right headers and body, and the server returns text that the user's browser renders as a web page
            that shows the updated information</p>
          <p>the server may never <code>PING</code>, but only <code>PONG</code></p>
          <p>to the server, <code>GET</code> and <code>PATCH</code> are unrelated&mdash;they might happen to share
            certain character sequences, or result in the invocation of some of the same code paths, but it's pure
            coincidence</p>
