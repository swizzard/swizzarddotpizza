          my Very Intelligent Wife suggested i look into community college

          i'm majoring in electrical engineering. it's normally a 2-year degree,
          but your boy is a delicate Humanities Simpleton and so needs to take
          remedial trig <em>and</em> pre-calc so who even knows

        <h3>week 2</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>math</strong> continues to be a bit of a struggle. i am kind
          of possibly trying to use this as an opportunity to Revisit My
          Approach To School, since i don't necessarily actually
          <em>need</em> this. i certainly don't need a 100 in remedial remedial
          math, lbr. also, ya boy is dolphinately gonna get covid, there is so
          much sneezing and coughing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>seminar</strong> continues to be low-key. tuesday's lab was an
          introduction to a pretty unpleasant wysiwyg static site editor called
          <code>ePortfolio</code>; thursday's class was basically just the
          professor assigning us to groups for our projects and explaining the
          existence of the app builder website and it was over in about 40
          minutes. sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>english</strong> class is fine. our first project will be a
          report on a historic engineering disaster. i chose the ford pinto,
          which in my mind <em>and my wife's</em> was just a famous lemon but
          actually killed a bunch of people. our first homework was to find and
          summarize an article about our disaster and cite and analyze a quote
          from it, and tbh i struggled to meet the length minimum. i think this
          and math might be a lot of likely alimentary tedium.

        <h3>week 1</h3>
        <p>i just finished my first week of classes:</p>
        <p>
          my <strong>math</strong> class is hard, so far. i think <s>the</s> a
          problem is that the first two weeks are necessarily super-remedial, in
          that there is an expected baseline of competence you're expected to
          get to and i don't know what i don't know. once the cadence normalizes
          and the homework is on the stuff covered in class it should be better
          (???)
        </p>
        <p>
          my <strong>seminar</strong> class is a bit of a mess: it's on zoom and
          the professor might have covid? we have to make a fake android app for
          engineers to learn about how to be engineers. figma has been
          mentioned; i'll be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          my <strong>english</strong> class is Technical Writing and i'm kind of
          stoked? the first reading assignment included a
          <title>what is technical communication?</title> piece that starts with
          "know
          <a href="./womm.html" target="_bank" title="WoMM">your audience</a>
          and address them appropriately" so you know i'm already down. also i
          have like
          <em>so many feelings</em> about Documentation that i would love a
          forum for.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="thought">
        <p>
          so we'll see! cautiously optimistic so far! i might fail math but
          we'll cross that bridge when we get there!
