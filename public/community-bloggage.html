          my Very Intelligent Wife suggested i look into community college
          instead of merely moping around the house Not Getting A Job

        <p>
          so i did, and now i'm enrolled at

          i'm majoring in electrical engineering. it's normally a 2-year degree,
          but your boy is a delicate Humanities Simpleton and so needs to take
          remedial trig <em>and</em> pre-calc so who even knows
        </p>

      <div class="thought">
        <p>i just finished my first week of classes:</p>
        <p>
          my <strong>math</strong> class is hard, so far. i think <s>the</s> a
          problem is that the first two weeks are necessarily super-remedial, in
          that there is an expected baseline of competence you're expected to
          get to and i don't know what i don't know. once the cadence normalizes
          and the homework is on the stuff covered in class it should be better
          (???)
        </p>

          my <strong>seminar</strong> class is a bit of a mess: it's on zoom and
          the professor might have covid? we have to make a fake android app for
          engineers to learn about how to be engineers. figma has been
          mentioned; i'll be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          my <strong>english</strong> class is Technical Writing and i'm kind of
          stoked? the first reading assignment included a
          <title>what is technical communication?</title> piece that starts with
          "know
          <a href="./womm.html" target="_bank" title="WoMM">your audience</a>
          and address them appropriately" so you know i'm already down. also i
          have like
          <em>so many feelings</em> about Documentation that i would love a
          forum for.

          so we'll see! cautiously optimistic so far! i might fail math but
          we'll cross that bridge when we get there!
