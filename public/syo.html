      <p>
        a relational database (management system) <i>is</i> an object, but
        <strong>ORMs don't model the entire database</strong>

        a table that has no foreign key or sequence columns and none of whose
        columns are referenced by foreign keys on any other table could
        conceivably "count" as an object, but such a table is neither realistic
        nor particularly useful.

        at least not well—perhaps as a meager API begrudgingly exposed through a
        `Connection` object, or in a smattering of arcane methods indifferently
        stuffed in the back of the documentation.

        this low-level API includes things like escaping content and connection

        your database is <i>not</i> your server. data in your database is
        <i>not</i> data in your process. that data is not coming from the cache,
        or from local memory at all. moving data from or to your database is an
        API call.
      </p>
      <p>
        the client library your ORM hides from you knows this. that is one
        reason your ORM hides the client library it uses from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        to let you treat data that lives in the database the same as data that
        lives in local memory—to erase the distance between that separate entity
        and your code—is a promise your ORM makes.

        the outcome of a database query is a snapshot of some portion of that
        database <i>at the time of the query</i>. once a query has been executed
        and its result made visible, the connection to "the truth" has already
        been severed.
      </p>
      <p>
        objects initialized with the results of queries also lack that epistemic
        connection—the `email` field of a `Author` object varies in complete
        independence from the `email` column of the `authors` table.
      </p>
      <p>
        initializing objects with the results of queries is one of two things
        your ORM does.

          are one affordance your database offers to mitigate issues this
          transiency can cause; there may be others depending on implementation.
          since ORMs don't model the database, taking advantage of said
          affordances is often unidiomatic and awkward, and not infrequently
          wholly infeasible.

        to write a changed field back into the database involves tearing the
        object apart and overwriting rows in the database, based on what is
        hoped to be a stable and unique set of identifiers.

        Your database has another API:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL is the <i>only</i> way of interacting with the kind of RDBMS under
        discussion. there is no bytecode, no assembly. there are no macros or
        compiler flags.
      </p>
      <p>There Is Only SQL.</p>
      <details class="aside">
        <summary>aside: SQL +</summary>
        actually, There Is Only SQL + whatever helpful commands are exposed by
        the RDMS's interactive mode—like
        <code>psql</code>'s backslash commands, <code>sqlite3</code>'s dot
        commands, or <code>mysql</code>'s "Database Administration
        Statements"—but since those commands are only available when using the
        interactive client, there's no way or need to make use of them when
        writing code.
      </details>
      <p>
        SQL is a programming language that is interpreted by the database
        itself. there is more readable SQL and less readable SQL; there is more
        performant SQL and less performant SQL. there are ways you can architect
        your tables etc. that make it easier or harder to write more or less
        readable or performant SQL in much the same way that there are ways you
        can architect your application towards similar ends.
      </p>
      <details class="aside">
        <summary>aside: aid</summary>
        among those helpful commands mentioned earlier are tools like
        <code>EXPLAIN</code>, available in both <code>psql</code> and
        <code>mysql</code>, that can help you write at least more performant
        SQL.
      </details>
      <p>
        your ORM produces SQL based on your code that it then sends to your
        database via a client library.
      </p>
      <p>
        producing SQL based on your code and sending it to your database via a
        client library is the second of two things your ORM does.
      </p>
      <p>
        you have no direct control over the SQL your ORM produces based on the
        code you write.
      </p>
      <p>
        your ORM does not show you the SQL it produces based on your code unless
        you specifically ask it to. it does not show you the SQL it produces
        because it is technically unnecessary to do so, and because the SQL it
        produces is usually neither readable nor performant.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>6</h2>
      <p>
        because ORMs model tables, maintaining the illusion that its objects are
        "normal" usually results in producing SQL that retrieves every column,
        usually by name. your ORM may also unexpectedly produce SQL that join on
        foreign keys, leaving your HTTP server or machine learning application
        or CLI tool to deal with having a few hundred<code>Book</code>s in
        memory when it just wanted an <code>Author</code>'s phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
        you can change your code to get your ORM not to produce SQL like that.
        if you don't change your code to get your ORM not to produce SQL like
        that, it will produce SQL like that. the exact ways to change your code
        to get your ORM not to produce SQL like that might be unidiomatic and
        ill-documented.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>7</h2>
      <p>
        because ORMs model tables, idiomaticity and quality of documentation
        often correlates negatively to the conceptual distance from that focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        database-native functions are treated in a lax and piebald manner. an
        ORM may elevate favored SQL functions to named methods or other
        documented constructs; the rest are invoked "stringly" or ignored in
        favor of equivalent functions run as part of your code.
      </p>

    <div class="section">

      <p>
        another promise your ORM makes is to let you ignore which specific
        <span data-tooltip="(e.g. SQLite 3.47 or MariaDB 10.0 or PostgreSQL 14)"
          >RDBMS implementation</span

        of

          >an ANSI standard</a
        >
        every RDBMS implements SQL a little bit differently.
      </p>
      <p>your ORM most values not being misunderstood.</p>
      <p>
        this concern both limits its output to a kind of "simplified SQL" that
        often lacks in both readability and performance, and proscribes its
        "blessed" (idiomatic, ergonomic, well-documented) API surface to favor
        easily-universalizable SQL constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        these constructs may or may not be well-suited for your use-cases. your
        RDBMS may offer different and more fitting constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        you may be able to change your code to get your ORM to produce
        different, better-suited SQL. you may be able to change your code to get
        your ORM to make use of features specific to your RDBMS. to do so is to
        force your ORM to break a promise; the ways in which you need to change
        your code will likely be unidiomatic and ill-documented, if they exist
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>your ORM is not a compiler.</p>

    <div class="section">

      <p>
        once your application progresses beyond the most trivial CRUD, there
        will come a day when Life and its exigencies will present to you and
        your ORM a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        it may be a problem of complexity or of scale or of performance; it may
        be a problem of presenting the contents of your database in a different
        way.
      </p>
      <p>whatever its nature, it will only be solved by you writing SQL.</p>
      <p>your ORM will fail you.</p>
