            people love to say "use common sense" or "use your best judgment"
          </p>
          <p>
            what they mean is "if you do not already know this, you are capable
            of deriving it trivially from what you do already know"
          </p>
          <p>this is due to a <i>presumption of knowledge</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>one speaks to be heard, one writes to be read</p>
          <p>this is as true for slam poetry as it is for source code</p>
          <p>every text is produced for, or to, or at <i>someone</i></p>
          <p>sometimes that someone is a novice sports bettor</p>
          <p>
            sometimes that someone is your wife as she was when you first met
            day in the park, at the very moment the light caught her hair
          </p>
          <p>sometimes that someone is an ambitious home cook</p>
          <p>
            sometimes that someone is mostly your social studies teacher but
            also that cute new kid
          </p>
          <p>
            sometimes that someone is your advisor, two additional faculty
            members from your department, and an additional scholar from another
            institution
          </p>
          <p>that someone does not only hear or read but Gets It</p>
          <p>
            they take the text and combine it with <i>all and only</i> what they
            are to produce exactly what the author wants to be produced (another
            interview, horniness, knowing 5 exciting color trends for spring, a
            Pulitzer, &amp;c.)
          </p>
          <p>
            all and only what they are is what is necessary to combine with the
            text, because they don't really exist

            the Ideal Reciever is often unknown to the author, or may differ

            some people think they can take advantage of this exploit by only

        <h2>III. What Can Be Done</h2>
        <div class="section">
          <h3>expectation</h3>
          <p>do not be afraid of the expectations you have of your audience</p>
          <p>technical writing is real, and strong, and your friend</p>
          <p>
            you're allowed to expect the people reading the comments in your C++
            code to know a thing or two about C++
          </p>
          <p>
            you're allowed to expect the people reading your article in the
            <i>Journal of the Society of Cinema and Media Studies</i> to know
            what you mean by "affect"
          </p>
          <p>
            it never hurts to be <strong>explicit</strong> and
            <strong>specific</strong>:
            <q>readers should be familiar with...</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            the less control you have over the constitution of your audience,
            the more you need to require
          </p>
          <p>
            documentation of private code that you write for your coworkers
            <i>should be different</i> than documentation of public code that
            you write for random strangers
          </p>
          <p>
            too many expectations can exclude people who might yet benefit, too
            few can include people who never will
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3>explanation</h3>
          <p>
            do not be afraid to set the scene, define your terms, bring everyone
            up to speed
          </p>
          <p>
            start from square <code>i</code> where
            <code>1 &lt;= i &lt; where you need to be</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            this is the rhetorical equivalent of static linking and bears the
            same risks of bloat plus the chance of looking like a condescending
            turd
          </p>
          <p>
            making additional documentation "opt-in" in the form of tooltips,
            collapsible sections, linking to other texts, etc. can help
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3>resignation</h3>
          <p>do not be afraid of being misunderstood</p>
          <p>it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility</p>
          <p>
            like any other error, the response should be determined by its
            frequency and severity
          </p>
