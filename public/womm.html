        <p>people love to say "use common sense" or "use your best judgment"</p>
        <p>
          what they mean is "if you do not already know this, you are capable of
          deriving it trivially from what you do already know"
        </p>
        <p>this is due to a <i>presumption of knowledge</i></p>

      <div class="section">
        <p>one speaks to be heard, one writes to be read</p>
        <p>this is as true for slam poetry as it is for source code</p>
        <p>every text is produced for, or to, or at <i>someone</i></p>
        <p>sometimes that someone is a novice sports bettor</p>
        <p>
          sometimes that someone is your wife as she was when you first met day
          in the park, at the very moment the light caught her hair
        </p>
        <p>sometimes that someone is an ambitious home cook</p>
        <p>
          sometimes that someone is mostly your social studies teacher but also
          that cute new kid
        </p>
        <p>
          sometimes that someone is your advisor, two additional faculty members
          from your department, and an additional scholar from another
          institution
        </p>
        <p>that someone does not only hear or read but Gets It</p>
        <p>
          they take the text and combine it with <i>all and only</i> what they
          are to produce exactly what the author wants to be produced (another
          interview, horniness, knowing 5 exciting color trends for spring, a
          Pulitzer, &amp;c.)
        </p>
        <p>
          all and only what they are is what is necessary to combine with the
          text, because they don't really exist

          we have also come to understand that repeatability is born from
