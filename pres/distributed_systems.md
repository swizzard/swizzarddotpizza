# Distributed Systems

- similarities to local multithreading
  - inherent overhead
    - ipc
    - lifecycle management
- distributing failure
  - loose coupling fosters resiliency
- time and locality
  - "edge" computing
  - scheduled tasks
- state
  - breaking state into pieces
    - _clear boundaries and ownership_
      - the browser stores a cookie, posts come from the database, images are proxied by microservice A while comments are handled by microservice B
    - coupling
      - temporal (A needs to happen before/after B)
        - user sessions
      - technical (A and B are stored such that retrieving both is minimally more expensive than retrieving just one)
        - db
      - logical (A cannot be properly processed without B or vice versa)
        - hydrating timeseries data?
  - transactionality
- intent vs results
  - write-ahead logs
  - optimism
- consistency and up-to-dateness are parameters
  - cache invalidation strategies, `Expires` header
  - batching operations
  - does every component on the dashboard really need to be maximally fresh?
- microservices
  - advantages
    - Doing One Thing
    - flexibility
    - resiliency
  - challenges
    - communication
      - timeouts, retries, idempotency
    - monitoring
- temporal.io
- kubernetes

- lucidchart
