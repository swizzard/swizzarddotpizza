## About Me
### Professional
I'm a professional, kind of. I'm currently doing computers in exchange for
money at a company called [Elite Daily](http://www.elitedaily.com). 
I get paid mostly to do Python, but I also really like Clojure and Go.
I don't *love* JavaScript, but I keep wanting to be convinced it's not just
something you have to use to pretty up your website.  
I did most of a Comp Ling degree, and I really like NLP and data
processing/parsing/wrangling/extracting.

[Here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/swizzarddotpizza/resume-spring2015.pdf) is
my resume (hasn't been updated recently), such as it is, if you want it.

### Personal
I live in Ridgewood, Queens, with my awesome wife. We don't have any
pets or anything. We watch a lot of tv. It's pretty chill.

I also have a [blog](http://blog.swizzard.pizza), at least for now.
