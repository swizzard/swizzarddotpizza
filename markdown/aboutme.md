## About Me
### Professional
I do Python webdev stuff at a lil' startup called [Roikoi](https://roikoi.com).  
I did most of a Comp Ling degree, and I really like NLP and data
processing/parsing/wrangling/extracting.


### Personal
I live in Austin, Texas with my awesome wife, who's a grad student at UT.
