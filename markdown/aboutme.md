## About Me
### Professional
I'm basically a professional. I just started doing computers at a place
called [Joor](https://jooraccess.com).  
I get paid mostly to do Python, but I also really like Clojure and Haskell.  
I've come around on JavaScript, or at least ES6.  
I did most of a Comp Ling degree, and I really like NLP and data
processing/parsing/wrangling/extracting.


### Personal
I live in Ridgewood, Queens, with my awesome wife. We don't have any
pets or anything. We watch a lot of tv. It's pretty chill.
