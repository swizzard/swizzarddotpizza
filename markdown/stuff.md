## Stuff
I've made some stuff. Some of it's helpful, most of it's silly, a few things
might be both?

### Twitter Bots

* [@sys_bot](http://twitter.com/__sys__bot__) tweets names for your mid-00s
    dance-rock cover band. Inspired, sort of, by
    [csvsoundsystem](https://twitter.com/csvsoundsystem)
    \[[source](https://github.com/swizzard/sys_bot)\]
* [@charlie_holzer](http://twitter.com/charlie_holzer) addresses
    [Jenny Holzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Holzer)'s
    [truisms](https://mfx.dasburo.com/art/truisms.html) to everyone's
    favorite fictional juvenile depressive, because...
    [@pareene](http://twitter.com/pareene) tweeted about it once and I thought
    it was a funny idea? I don't know.

* [@civ5_jobs](https://twitter.com/civ5_jobs) answers the question "What if
    ~~I~~ someone took the whole 'such-and-such ninja' cliche _too far_?"

### Other stuff

* [ktg.io](http://www.ktg.io) is a website I wrote that solves one of
    humanity's oldest problems: what should I tattoo across my knuckles?
    \[[source](https://github.com/swizzard/ktg.io)\]
* [botmaster](https://github.com/swizzard/botmaster) is a teensy Python lib I
    wrote that at least tries to make creating twitter bots easier. Basically,
    after you figure out your OAuth stuff (there's some hopefully-helpful stuff
    about that process in the docs), you just decorate a function that returns
    a string or generator, and the rest is easy.
* [miniconfig](https://github.com/swizzard/miniconfig) is a Python
    config-manager thing. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
* [lyrics](https://github.com/swizzard/lyrics) is a thing I'm writing in
    Clojure to scrape lyrics from one of those free websites and put them in
    Neo4J. The ultimate goal is something like Rap Genius meets
    [COCA](http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/).
* There's also
    [a half-finished parser & lexer written in Go](https://github.com/swizzard/rakerdirz),
    and the remains of my aborted Comp Ling Masters' thesis, in
    [Python](https://github.com/swizzard/ts) and
    [Clojure](https://github.com/swizzard/ts-clojure) flavors.
