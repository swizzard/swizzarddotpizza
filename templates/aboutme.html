<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Professional</h3>
<p>I'm a professional, kind of. I'm currently doing computers in exchange for
money at a company called <a href="http://www.elitedaily.com">Elite Daily</a>. 
I get paid mostly to do Python, but I also really like Clojure and Go.
I don't <em>love</em> JavaScript, but I keep wanting to be convinced it's not just
something you have to use to pretty up your website.<br />
I did most of a Comp Ling degree, and I really like NLP and data
processing/parsing/wrangling/extracting.</p>

my resume (hasn't been updated recently), such as it is, if you want it.</p>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>I live in Ridgewood, Queens, with my awesome wife. We don't have any
pets or anything. We watch a lot of tv. It's pretty chill.</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="http://blog.swizzard.pizza">blog</a>, at least for now.</p>
